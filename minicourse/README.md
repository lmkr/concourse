# Plan for PCS911 - Spring 2021

## Lecture 1: Overview of Coloured Petri Nets and CPN Tools

### Plan

- Motivation for Coloured Petri Nets
- Overview of Coloured Petri Nets
- Installation and basic use of CPN Tools

### Reading material

- Overview paper of CPNs: https://github.com/lmkr/cpncourse/blob/master/papers/cpn-acm-2015.pdf
- Chapter 1 of the CPN Book: https://github.com/lmkr/cpnbook/blob/master/chapters/chapter1.pdf

Note that there is some overlap between the overview paper and the book chapter. We will cover the details contained in the overview paper later on in the mini-course.

### Tasks

- Download and install CPN Tools on your PC: http://cpntools.org/2018/01/15/windows/
- Clone this Git repository to get easy access to the course material: https://github.com/lmkr/cpncourse
- Do some basic simulation and editing using the two-phase commit example model: https://github.com/lmkr/cpncourse/blob/master/models/lecture1-introduction.cpn

## Lecture 2: Place/Transition Nets

### Plan

- Syntax and semantics of Place/Transition Nets

### Reading material

- Chapter 1-3 (pages 1-34) in Wolfgang Reisig: A Primer in Petri Net Design. Springer-Verlag, 1992.
- Read the description of the two-phase commit protocol in https://github.com/lmkr/cpncourse/blob/master/papers/cpn-acm-2015.pdf

### Tasks

- Basic PT-net modelling and simulation exercises in CPN Tools

## Lecture 3: Coloured Petri Nets

- Syntax and semantics of CPNs
- Basic CPN modelling and simulation exercises in CPNs

## Lecture 4: The CPN ML language
